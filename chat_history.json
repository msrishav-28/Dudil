It's completely normal to feel a little lonely or even angry when you compare your situation to others.  It sounds like you're surrounded by couples, which can make those feelings even stronger.\n\nRemember that social media often presents a very curated and unrealistic view of people's lives.  What you see isn't necessarily the whole picture.  Many people experience loneliness and singlehood, even if they don't share it openly.\n\nInstead of focusing on what others are doing, maybe we could explore what *you* want and need right now.  What are some things that bring you joy or fulfillment outside of romantic relationships?  Perhaps we could brainstorm some activities or ways to connect with people who share your interests.\n",

It's completely understandable to feel sad and frustrated when opportunities slip away.  Remember that setbacks are a part of life, and they don't diminish your worth or your hard work.  Can you tell me a bit more about a specific situation where this happened?  Sometimes talking it through can help to process the feelings and maybe even identify areas where things could be approached differently in the future.  Even if it doesn't feel like it right now, you're not alone in this, and your hard work will eventually pay off.\n",
